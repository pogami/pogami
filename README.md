# hey, i’m adam 👋

I like taking rough ideas and turning them into products real people can actually use.

Right now, that looks like:

- building **[CourseConnect AI](https://courseconnectai.com)**, a study copilot that helps college students turn messy syllabi into structured plans and on‑demand help  
- building **GaitGuard**, an Apple Watch app that uses motion and haptic feedback to support people with Parkinson’s during freezing‑of‑gait episodes  

I learn by shipping: trying things, breaking them, and fixing them until they work—more than by memorizing syntax or chasing tutorial checklists.

always learning. always shipping.
